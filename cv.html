            <h3>Internet Security</h3>
            I am interested in Internet security from both research and teaching
            points of view.  I use the label Internet security to include network
            security and system security.  I and my students have been exploring
            security hardening the Linux kernel, improving security during the
            /sbin/init stage, etc.

            <h3>Software Design Environments</h3>
            I am building a <i>design environment</i>, called DOME.  This
            environment will facilitate not only the process of design, but also
            the manipulation of the resulting designs.  Designs are expressed in
            &#212;M.  It will contain limited domain theorem provers to facilitate
            qualitative analysis, design knowledge bases to guide ongoing process
            of design, and visually oriented debuggers and test generators that
            can profitably use the abstract views as found in designs.
            To date, over a dozen MS theses, and three PhD dissertations (two
            under my direction) have been produced on this project.

            <h3>Formal Methods in Software Engineering</h3>
            Work on DOME focusses on developing formal specifications and
            correctness proofs of realistic, but still rather small, programs with
            computer support essential for the application of formal methods to be
            fruitful in practice.

            <h3>Limited Domain Theorem Proving</h3>
            In the formal verification of programs from a rather limited
            domain of problems, the mathematical theorems that need to be proven
            have such properties that decision procedures can be devised for them.
            [Mateti 81] work is considered original in this area.  We wished to
            extend our method of using closure and local implication rules to a
            wider class of problems than the small subset of sorting domain that
            we proved decidable.  We have extended this to include Shell-sort also.

            <h3>Transformations</h3>
            I have studied algorithms that destructively traverse data
            structures, while returning it to original state before they are done.
            We developed the semantic notion of "abstract equivalence" which is
            important for such an understanding of recursion.  We demonstrated by
            a series of program transformations the presence of in situ stacks in
            Morris' tree traversal algorithm, the Towers of Hanoi problem and the
            generalized list marking algorithms.  I am presently developing a
            high-level language to express parse-tree based transformations.

            The design of a design specification language, called &#212;M, is an

            <h3>Automated Drawings</h3>
            Even though diagrams are used widely in all areas of design, and
            specifically in programming, only a few papers consider the systematic
            drawing of them, and address topics such as (1) what makes the
            displays look pleasant or unpleasant, (2) how to draw diagrams
            aesthetically and automatically, (3) how do diagrams affect our
            productivity.  We have done good work towards automating the drawing
            of data structures.

            <h2>Software Developed</h2>
            I have developed the following software practicing the software
            engineering and formal methods principles that I preach.

            <h3><tt>Gul&#228;m</tt></h3>
            <tt>Gul&#228;m</tt>&nbsp;is a command line interpreter.  The Atari ST (an MC68000-based
            personal computer) version was released as a non-profit distribution
            to the public in 1987.  It is now kept in all the anonymous FTP
            archives for that machine.  It is in daily use by thousands.  It
            integrated an Emacs-like editor, command line history, etc. into a
            very compact program.  These features are now common-place in modern
            shells.

            <h3>al := 0</h3>
            This is a programming language clinging to the native instruction
            set of a CPU.  I developed two similar looking languages:
            al:=0 for  MC68000, and al:=0 for i8086.  My students Chuck
            Heller, and Jay Patel developed compilers for these.

            <h3>Indent</h3>
            <tt>Indent</tt> is a pretty-printer for Pascal source code.  It was in wide
            use because of its speed, and compactness.  It also happens to be a
            proven-correct program (see my Publications).

            <h3>DOME</h3>
            DOME is a computer-aided design environment for software based
            on formal methods.  This is an on-going project at present.
