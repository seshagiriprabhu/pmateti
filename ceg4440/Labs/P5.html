            <p>The purpose of this lab is to get you deeper into code injection
            attacks in PCs and Android devices.  
            </p>

            <h3>Task 1: Bash Shellshock Injection (CVE-2014-6271)</h3>
            <p>Task: (i) Visit a CVE database, and read all about CVE-2014-6271,
            and related CVEs, e.g., CVE-2014-7187.  (ii) Download and install
            (latest) bash (ARM) binary into your Android device. (iii) Verify if
            your laptop Linux bash (already installed) has this vulnerability.
            (iv) Verify if your Android device bash has this vulnerability.
            </p>

            <strong>Deliverables:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Short (one or two paragraph) reports on each of the
                    above items.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Task 2: Make <a href="../Lectures/Injection/modret.c">modret.c</a> Skip Lines of Code </h3>
            Goal: Understand the stack smashing buffer exploit /thoroughly/.
            You are permitted to do this task on a Linux PC.
            <ol>
                <li> Improve the code of =exploit4.c= of AlephOne so that there are
                    no warning messages whatsoever from =gcc= even after using the
                    flags as in <code>=gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall=</code>
                </li>
                <li>Reduce the size of their compiled binaries by at least 5% as
                    seen by the =size= command under the text column. Make sure no
                    functionality is lost.  Removing printf's amounts to changing
                    functionality.  Optimized rewriting of portions of source code is
                    permitted.  You must use the same gcc (optimization or other)
                    flags.
                </li>
                <li> Compile and run =modret.c=.  (Instructions to
                    compile and examine the assembly code are embedded as comments in
                    the code.)  Your goal is to make this process print 
                    <ul>
                        <li>"now, x == 66"</li>
                        <li>"now, x == 44"</li>
                        <li>"now, x == 11</li>
                    </ul>
                    by invoking the
                    modret program three times with chosen integers.  /You may need to
                    modify the numbers appearing with the modret procedure./ Record
                    your process of discovering these numbers.  A relevant code segment
                    from this file is reproduced here:
                    <pre>x = 0x11;
modret(y, z, 0x234); /* easy to recognize number */
x += 0x22;
x += 0x33;
printf("now, x == %x\n", x); </pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>

            <strong>Deliverables:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li><code>=exploit4-improved.c=</code> 
                    <li><code>=size exploit4-improved=</code></li>
                    <li>=modret= input + output showing three values of x.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Task 3: StageFright </h3>
            <p> Task: There are (Oct 2015) a few APKs on Google Play that (claim
            to) detect if the StageFright library within your device is
            vulnerable still or patched up.  Install one such APK and report on
            its results.
            <br/>
            <strong>Deliverables:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>screenshot of the installed APK</li> 
                <li>screenshot of the results</li>
                <li>short summary and critique of the APK</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Task 4: ASLR in Android</h3>
            <p>Task: Develop a program/APK that we can install within Android that
            tells us if ASLR is enabled or not, and offers evidence of the
            conclusion.  Implement this in C/C++/ Java/ Scala/ Python.  It need
            not be an APK.  It is acceptable if it can be invoked via =adb
            shell=.  Suggestion: Try this program out first on a Linux PC and
            then cross-compile it for Android.
            <p>Warning: Conceptual discussions on this task among students/faculty
            is permitted, but not implementation details, certainly not code
            sharing.  Code must be /yours/ (not "borrowed" from the web or
            whereever).
            <br/>
            <strong>Deliverables:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Source code of program/APK. Well commented</li> 
                <li>Its design description.</li>
                <li>Example outputs of test runs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Task B: Bonus </h3>
            <p>
            This part is optional, but highly encouraged.  Your score is
            proportional to your success.  Bonus points, from P2, P3, ..., are
            used to help push you into one-better-letter grade than what you would
            otherwise get.  E.g., if you are about get a B, with enough bonus
            points, you might get an A instead.  This is done without having any
            lowering effect of the normal A's for other students.  All of this is
            subjectively judged; no algorithmic details or grading rubric will be
            given.  Sub taks:
            <ol>
                <li>   (05 points) Make a list of =suid= programs within your
                    Android device.
                </li>
                <li> (10 points) Do the modret Task 2 above within Android.</li>
                <li> (10 points) Buid a shellcode for an Android ARM device.</li>
                <li> (25 points) In your Android device, disable ASLR, etc. Demonstrate that 
                    the shellcode can actually exploit a vulnerable suid program.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            <strong>Deliverables:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A design description of shell code construction.</li>
                <li>Typescript showing off the exploit</li>
                <li>Complete source code bundled as tar ball</li>
            </ul>
