            <br/>
            The purpose of this lab is to get you deeper into security issues
            in/around Android using APKs of free open source versions
            (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a>).  <strike>Recall
            the content of our
            <a href="./ethicsStmt.html"> Ethics Statement</a></strike>.

            <h3>Task 1: Malicious Apps </h3>
            Task: Study the design, the source code, and actual use of
            a <i>malicious</i> app.  Use the one described below or some other,
            but open source, of your choice.

            <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sms-bomber/">
                https://code.google.com/p/sms-bomber/</a> bombards your "friends"
            with many SMS in a short period.  Study the code so that you truly
            understand all its internals.  Before bombarding install an 
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=anti%20sms%20spam&c=apps">
                Anti SMS Spam</a> app.
            Alternate download:

                https://github.com/pmateti/sms-bomber/</a>

            SMS messages can be sent
            <a href="http://xjaphx.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/">
                among AVDs running on the same machine</a>, 
            but not between an AVD and a real device.

            <br/>
            <strong>Deliverables</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li>A <i>design</i> description of the app</li>
                <li>Screenshots showing all the bad effects implemented.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Task 2: Privacy</h3>
            Task: Experience a privacy enhancing app.  Use the one described
            below or some other well trusted app of your choice.
            TextSecure "encrypts your text and chat messages over the air and
            on your phone."  It is available on Google Play.  FOSS:
            <a href="https://whispersystems.org/"> whispersystems.org</a>.

            <br/>
            <strong>Deliverables</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>The apk you chose.  Include even if it is the one above.</li> 
                <li>A description why you trust this app</li>

                <li>Selected screenshots of the app annotated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Task 3: Internals</h3>
            Task: Learn more of Android Internals related to security.  Answer
            any two of the "exercises" presented by <i>the</i> following app.
            IGLearner app is designed to teach internals and security of
            Android through puzzles/ quizzes.  It is available on Google Play.
            FOSS: <a href="https://github.com/intrepidusgroup/ig-learner">
                github.com/intrepidusgroup/ig-learner</a>

            <br/>
            <strong>Deliverables</strong>:
            <br/>
            Studying the source code of iglearner is optional
            <ul>
                <li>Your answers to two of the "exercises" presented by iglearner.</li>
                <li>Related annotated screenshots.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Task 4: Reversing </h3>
            Task: Reverse engineer the details of an apk for which we <i>do not</i>
            have source code.  Use the one described below or some other of your
            choice.  It need not be a malware.

            Zeam is an "underdog minimalistic launcher" rated 4+ stars, with a 1M+
            installs.  It is available on
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zeam">
                Google Play
            </a>.  It is free to use, but not known to be open source.  Our goal
            is not to break the intentions of its author but practice the art of
            reversing on a tool that is impressively small for all the
            functionality it packs.

            <br/>
            <strong>Deliverables</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>The apk you chose.  Include even if it is the one above.</li>
                <li>Bundle of all derived/ reverse engineered files as a tar
                    ball or zip</li>
                <li>A deduced <i>design</i> description of the app.</li>
                <li>Selected screenshots, not of the app but of the reversing,
                    annotated.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Task B: Bonus </h3>

            This part is optional, but highly encouraged.  Your score is
            proportional to your success.  Bonus points, from P2, P3, ..., are
            used to help push you into one-better-letter grade than what you would
            otherwise get.  E.g., if you are about get a B, with enough bonus
            points, you might get an A instead.  This is done without having any
            lowering effect of the normal A's for other students.  All of this is
            subjectively judged; no algorithmic details or grading rubric will be
            given.
            <h4>Malicious App and its AntiDote [Bonus Points 20+ 20 (+ 10?)]</h4>

            Task: Write a pair of apps: one a malicious app (20 points) and the other that
            protects (20 points) from this app.  These must be of <i>your own</i> design.
            Make sure that there are no lingering "bad" effects after terminating your
            app.   Assume that your apps are side-loaded by the user, but verified by
            the built-in app-install subsystem.
            Ten additional bonus points if your app is devious.

                <li>Screenshots showing each of the bad effects implemented </li>
                <li>The APKs</li>
                <li>Complete source code bundled as a tar ball or zip.</li>

            <h4>Update CommonContacts [Bonus Points 20+ 20]</h4>

            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.virginia.cs.secgrp.seccomp.contacts2">
                Common Contacts</a>, edu.virginia.cs.secgrp.seccomp.contacts2, is
            available on

                Google Play</a>.  It deserves lot more downloads.  It was done in
            2011.  "CommonContacts allows two users to collaboratively discover
            common entries in their address books without disclosing any other
            information about their contacts. The application uses a secure
            computation framework built using [author] Yao's garbled circuit
            technique. All computation involving private data is performed on
            encrypted data so no information is released to the other party
            (other than what can be inferred from the result)."
            Task: (20 points) Web search and find its source code. Update this
            for Lollipop/Marshmallow.  Use material design, etc.  (20 points)
            Write a design document.
